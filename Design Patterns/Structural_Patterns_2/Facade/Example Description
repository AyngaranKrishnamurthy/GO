We are going to take first steps towards writing our very own library that access *OpenWeatherMaps* service.
In case if you are not familiar with *OpenWeatherMaps* service, it is an HTTP service that provides you with live information about the
weather, as well as historical data on it. The HTTPREST API is very easy to use, and will be a good example of how to create a Facade 
pattern for hiding the complexity of the network behind the REST service.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
    1. Provide a single type to access the data. All information retrieved through OpenWeatherMaps service will pass through it.
    2. Create a way to get weather data from some city of some country.
    3. Create a way to get weather data from some latitude and longitude posistion.
    4. Only second and third points should be visisble outside the package and everything else must be hidden.
