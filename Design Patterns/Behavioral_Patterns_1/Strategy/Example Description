In this example instead of printing text on the console only, we are also going to paint objects on a file.
In this case we will have two strategies: console and file. But the user of the library won't have to deal with the complexity behind it.
The key feature is that the caller doesn't know how the underlying library is working and he just knows the information available on defined strategy.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
    1. Provide a way to show to an user an object(a square) in text or image.
    2. The user must choose between image or text while launching the app.
    3. The app must be able to add more visualization strategies (for example: audio).
    4. If the user selects text the word *Square* must be printed onto the console.
    5. If the user selects image, an image of white square on black background will be printed onto a file.
