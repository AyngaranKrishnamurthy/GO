=> It is similar to strategy design pattern but with key differences.
=> In strategy pattern we focus on changing algorithms, in command pattern we focus on the invocation of something

=> The command pattern, as the name suggests, is used when we want to create and execute “commands”. 
Different commands have their own implementation, but have the same steps for execution.
