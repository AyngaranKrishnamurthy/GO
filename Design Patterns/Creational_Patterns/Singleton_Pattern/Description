​Makes only one instance of an object and guarantees no duplicate. 
For the first call the instance is created and the same instance is used throughout the program

​Example - a unique counter
    As an example of an object of which we must ensure that there is only one instance, we will write a counter that 
    holds the number of times it has been called during program execution. It shouldn't matter how many instances we have
    of the counter, all of them must count the same value and it must be consistent between the instances.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
    1. When no counter has been created before, a new one is created with the value 0
    2. If a counter has already been created, return this instance that holds the actual count
    3. If we call the method Addone, the count must be incremented by 1
