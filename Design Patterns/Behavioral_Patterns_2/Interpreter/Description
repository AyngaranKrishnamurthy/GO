EXAMPLE: 
A reverse polish notation calculator, it's a mathematical notation to make operations where you write the operations first(sum)
and the the values(3,4), so + 3 4 is equivalent to the more common 3+4 and result is 7.

ACCEPTANCE Criteria:
1. Create a language that allows making common arithmetic operations. The syntax is sum for sums, mul for multiplications, sub for subtraction and div for division
2. It must be done using reverse polish notation
3. The user must be able to write as many operations in a row as they want.
4. The operation must be performed from left to right.
